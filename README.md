## About Dreamit
Dreamit is a simple 'software as a service' web application that allows you to edit images using cloudinary's AI.

It has the ability to:
* Resore images by removing noise and imperfections
* Enhance an image's dimensions using AI outpainting
* Identify and eliminate objects from images
* Identify and recolor objects from the image
* Remove the background of the image using AI

Each image transformation uses a 'token'. More tokens can be purchased to create more transformations.

Every user can see others' transformations on the main page! All transformations are uploaded to be seen publicly
